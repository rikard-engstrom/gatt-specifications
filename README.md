# GATT Specifications

Since the information at https://www.bluetooth.com/specifications/gatt/ is kind of hard to obtain.
It only has links to pdf's and those pdfs does not have all information.

There are however xml-files available but I haven't found any links to them.

I have created this repository and wiki to make it more accessible.

# 16-bit UUID Numbers
16-bit UUID Numbers.json is a json-representation of the pdf that can be downloaded from
https://btprodspecificationrefs.blob.core.windows.net/assigned-values/16-bit%20UUID%20Numbers%20Document.pdf

# GATT Services
[Gatt Services](https://github.com/rikard-engstrom/gatt-specifications/wiki/Services)

# GATT Specification Supplement
This document [GATT Specification Supplement PDF](https://www.bluetooth.org/DocMan/handlers/DownloadDoc.ashx?doc_id=502132&vId=542989)
Is actually what I was looking for. I don't where you are expected to find this link. I found it in a post on stackoverflow.
The document contains data fields for characteristics.
